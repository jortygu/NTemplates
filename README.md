NTemplates is a reporting library for .NET written 100% in C#. It allows your end users to define custom report templates as RTF Documents. This way, your application just needs to specify the placeholders for letting the user build a given template, and the required data for generating the report. NTemplates will generate the report based on the usersâ€™ report template. 

The final report is also a RTF document, so it can be edited or used in any other way an RTF document could be used.

NTemplates includes a very simple interpreted programming language. This allows templates complexity vary from very simple placeholder replacement, to much more complex report definitions; IF and LOOP constructions with headers an summaries.

This project started as a hobby, and it's my humble intent to give back to the development community a little piece of what I got all these year of being a software developer. I'm offering this component to anyone that may need it for any project; open source or not, or even commercial.
